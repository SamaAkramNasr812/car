# Car Price Prediction App

## Description
The Car Price Prediction App is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of cars based on various features such as engine size, fuel type, and other specifications. The app leverages a linear regression model trained on a comprehensive dataset of car prices, providing users with an intuitive interface to input car features and obtain price predictions. This tool is valuable for potential car buyers and sellers looking to understand market prices and make informed decisions.
